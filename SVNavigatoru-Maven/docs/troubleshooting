Issue 1
--------
Diacritic signs are not properly handled in production. Locally it's OK.


Solution
--------
Add the following line to bin/setenv.sh in CATALINA_HOME:

  JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dfile.encoding=UTF8"

Moreover, tell the JDBC connector which encoding to use (jdbc*.properties):

  jdbc.url=*?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
